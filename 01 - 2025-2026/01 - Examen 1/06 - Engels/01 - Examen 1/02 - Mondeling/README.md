## Dia 1
Hello everyone,
Today I want to share my draft itinerary for a sustainable holiday in Switzerland. My goal is to explore this beautiful country while respecting nature and supporting local communities.
## Dia 2
I plan to start my trip in **Zermatt**, a car-free mountain village. I would like to go hiking in the Alps and enjoy the fresh mountain air. I also want to try skiing on eco-friendly slopes that use renewable energy for their lifts.
## Dia 3
Next, I will travel to **Bern**, the capital city. I plan to visit the Bear Park, where rescued bears live in a natural environment. I would also like to taste traditional Swiss dishes made from local ingredients and explore the Old Town, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site.
## Dia 4
After Bern, I want to go to **Lucerne**. There, I plan to take a boat ride on the lake to admire the scenery without harming the environment. I would like to visit the Transport Museum to learn about sustainable travel in Switzerland and walk across the famous Chapel Bridge.
## Dia 5
My fourth stop will be **Interlaken**. I want to experience a paragliding adventure to see the mountains from above, and I plan to hike along scenic trails to enjoy the peaceful landscapes. I would also like to visit local farms to learn about sustainable agriculture and taste fresh produce.
## Dia 6
Finally, I will end my trip in **Lausanne**. I plan to visit the Olympic Museum to learn about sports and sustainability. I would like to cycle along the lake on one of the city’s bike paths and explore the Lavaux Vineyards, where I can see how wine is produced using eco-friendly methods.

Through this journey, I hope to travel responsibly, appreciate nature, and support local communities. This sustainable holiday will not only be relaxing but also meaningful.

Thank you.
